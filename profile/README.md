Web hosting definition
To make a website functional you need to do two things — register a domain name and purchase a hosting plan. These are both essential and your website will not be possible without them.

When your website is only stored on your computer, Internet users don’t have access to it. Web hosting is the service that allows you to rent a space on the Internet for your website content (HTML, CSS, and image files), so it’s made available to the world. All websites need to be hosted on a server to be viewable online.

When a hosting provider allocates space on a web server for a website to store its files, it’s hosting the website. All websites are hosted on a certain kind of server.

So what is a server? It’s a device that connects other web users to your site from anywhere in the world. 

Web hosting service providers have the servers, connectivity, and associated services to host websites. By offering different hosting plans, they cover a range of hosting needs from small personal blogs to business websites.

The amount of space allocated on a server to a website depends on the type of hosting. The main types of website hosting are shared, dedicated, virtual private server (VPS), and reseller hosting. They are differentiated by the kind of technology used for the server, technical characteristics, the level of management provided, and additional services provided. 

Shared hosting is easy to manage even for beginners, and it usually comes at low prices. If you need root access to the server and the chance to install certain software and perform specific changes, a dedicated server may be the best choice.

If you’re planning to create an online presence, you need your web hosting to be reliable. There are now hundreds of web hosts available, providing hosting services in the thousands. There are plans ranging from those that are free with limited options to expensive web hosting services specialized for businesses. The plan you choose will depend primarily on how you plan to use your website, what basic and additional features you need for the website, and how much you have budgeted for hosting.

Choosing the right hosting plan will mean having access to the right allocation of resources to keep your website loading quickly and reliably for your visitors. Carefully consider the web hosting solution you need. 

Many businesses now operate primarily online, with their sales and business leads coming directly from their website. Whenever a potential customer lands on a website and there's a problem, such as it takes too long to load, they probably won't wait around. It’s easy to find another option that works correctly and can deliver what they are looking for.

If you’re new to operating a website, web hosting and all related lingo can be a puzzling topic. Many inexperienced website owners have used the cheapest option or anything bundled with their domain registration under the mistaken belief that all hosting options are essentially the same.

This can be a costly mistake.

This article includes everything you need to know about web hosting and how choosing the right plan is essential to the success of your website.
